    Applications requiring low-latency, reliable packet processing are challenging for today's network and service management when resources are limited and must be shared. 
	Containers are suitable, but achieving connectivity between containers exclusively in software is unsuitable for these requirements.
	The impact of network latencies in containerized environments has received comparatively less attention, especially compared to research on virtual machines.
	This paper analyzes throughput and network latencies in container-based topologies on a single host featuring single-root input/output virtualization, Linux Containers, and commercial off-the-shelf hardware.
	We conduct measurements with a state-of-the-art timestamping methodology to identify tail-latency behavior, resulting in a resolution of 1.25 µs.
	We evaluate a single flow in a line topology with up to 64 containers and a complex topology with 38 flows and 12 nodes.
	The experiments demonstrate that pinning interrupt request handlers to non-uniform memory access nodes increases throughput and decreases latencies.
	Furthermore, we identify dTLB misses, rescheduling interrupts, and soft interrupt floods as critical challenges causing spikes in latencies while isolation remains impossible.
	A comparison with VM measurements shows that containers can achieve up to 60 µs lower latencies.
	Our findings identify bottlenecks for real-time container applications and provide suggestions to reduce their impact.
